# Google Dorking Sample

Google Dorking (aka Google Hacking) is the use of advanced search operators to uncover hidden or sensitive information indexed by Google. Google Dorking is not hacking in itself; it's a search technique. It's a powerful technique used in ethical hacking, OSINT, and penetration testing.

Google can't directly prevent Dorking attacks on your website, as it's a search engine. Protecting your website from Dorking and other attacks requires your own security measures and practices.

Responsible disclosure involves reporting any vulnerabilities or sensitive information discovered through Google Dorking to the relevant parties, allowing them to address the issue before it's publicly disclosed.

Cybersecurity professionals use Google Dorking as part of their threat intelligence and research activities to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats
